## Token Distribution

### Allocation Strategy

Based on the deployed smart contract specifications and TED Protocol's fair launch principles:

import TokenDistributionTable from '@site/src/components/TokenDistributionTable';

<TokenDistributionTable />

### On-Chain Distribution Verification

Unlike many DeFi projects with complex vesting schedules, TEDP's distribution is designed for transparency and immediate utility:

#### Initial Supply Distribution
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 TEDP (fixed, non-inflationary)
- **Initial Holder**: Contract deployer receives full supply at launch
- **Distribution Method**: Manual distribution to designated allocation wallets
- **Verification**: All transfers are publicly auditable on TRON blockchain

#### Smart Contract Guarantees
The deployed contract ensures:
- No additional token minting capability
- Fixed total supply of 1 billion tokens
- Transparent burn mechanism reducing total supply
- Real-time circulating supply calculation

#### Burn Mechanism Impact
According to the contract's burn functionality:
```solidity
function _burn(address account, uint256 amount) internal {
    _balances[account] -= amount;
    _totalSupply -= amount;  // Reduces total supply
    emit Transfer(account, address(0), amount);
    emit Burn(account, amount);
}
```

This creates a deflationary tokenomics model where:
- Circulating Supply = Total Supply - Total Burned
- Each burn permanently reduces maximum possible supply
- Burn events are tracked in `totalBurned` variable

### Distribution Rationale

Public Sale (15%)
- Ensures fair initial distribution
- Price discovery mechanism
- Community building foundation
- No VC preferential terms

### Value Accrual Mechanism

The smart contract implements a sophisticated fee distribution system:

```
Transaction Fees → Smart Contract Collection → Automatic Distribution
                                              ├── Burn Fee → Permanent Supply Reduction
                                              ├── Liquidity Fee → DEX Liquidity Enhancement
                                              ├── Staking Fee → Staking Contract Rewards
                                              └── Treasury Fee → Protocol Development
```

#### Real-Time Fee Processing
Every transaction triggers the fee calculation function:
```solidity
function _calculateFees(uint256 amount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalFee = burnFee + liquidityFee + stakingFee + treasuryFee;
    return (amount * totalFee) / 10000;  // Basis points calculation
}
```

#### Automated Fee Distribution
The contract automatically handles fee distribution:
1. **Burn Processing**: Immediate token burn and supply reduction
2. **Staking Rewards**: Direct transfer to staking contract with reward notification
3. **Treasury Allocation**: Instant transfer to designated treasury wallet
4. **Liquidity Enhancement**: Accumulated for automated liquidity additions

#### Fee Statistics Tracking
The contract maintains comprehensive fee statistics:
- `totalBurned`: Cumulative tokens permanently removed
- `totalLiquidityFees`: Total fees allocated to liquidity
- `totalStakingFees`: Total rewards distributed to stakers
- `totalTreasuryFees`: Total protocol development funding
- `totalTransactions`: Network activity metrics
